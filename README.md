# mc-biomes-coverage-tool
A tool for estimating the coverage of Minecraft biomes. 

The tool analyzes a collection of map snapshots in an image form saved on www.chunkbase.com/apps/biome-finder

The colour codes that Chunkbase uses and available Minecraft biomes can be found here: https://github.com/toolbox4minecraft/amidst/wiki/Biome-Color-Table

In the data folder there are 2 screenshots that serve as a simple way to load in a colour-to-biome dictionary/map.

Simply populate the overworld/nether/the end folders and change the path accordingly in the python script to start the analysis. 1 sample image for each dimension has been included - the script expects images from chunkbase's biome-finder.
